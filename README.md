### 📖 Project Overview
This website serves as the **foundational pillar** of my digital portfolio, marking my transition from cloud-based sandboxes like CodePen to a professional, local-to-remote development workflow. By migrating this project into a structured Git environment, I have demonstrated core competencies in **version control** and **production-ready architecture**.

Designed with a "mobile-ready" philosophy, the site ensures a seamless experience across all devices. It bridges the gap between creative aesthetic and technical execution, utilizing **semantic HTML5** and **CSS3** to create a high-performance landing page. This project stands as a living document of my commitment to clean code and user-centric design.

### 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Architecture:** Migrated from CodePen to a local `dist/` folder structure.
* **Styling:** Responsive CSS3 featuring Flexbox and Media Queries.
* **Workflow:** Managed via GitHub Desktop for precise version tracking.
* **Deployment:** Hosted via GitHub Pages.
* **Clean UI/UX:** A minimalist design approach to ensure content is easy to read.
* **Performance Optimized:** Lightweight code structure for fast loading times.
