This website is a responsive personal portfolio designed to showcase my digital identity and serves as a central hub for my professional profile. It represents a significant milestone in my development journey: my first transition from a cloud-based sandbox (CodePen) to a professional local development environment.

Featuring a clean user interface and a focused layout, the project is engineered to highlight my current technical skills and aesthetic vision. It is a structured landing page designed to demonstrate my core competencies in front-end development, semantic HTML, and version control.
